This script analyzes data in a drone_data.db database with three SQL queries. First, it counts the unique pilots in the pilots table. Second, it calculates the average flight hours from the pilots table. Finally, it determines the inventory of each drone model in the drones table. The script then prints the results to the console, displaying pilot statistics and drone model inventory counts.
